          <p>Facebook Groups Can Completely Change the Way Your Followers See
            Your Brand – And Most Businesses Ignore Them!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mostPop">
          <p><span>From:</span> [Qadeer Musaddaq]</p>
          <p>What if I told you that you were currently <strong>ignoring the
              biggest and most powerful social media marketing tool</strong>
            there is?</p>
          <p>So, many businesses that are keen to promote their brands on
            Facebook will focus purely on Facebook pages.</p>
          <p>This is a huge mistake, seeing as Facebook <em>groups </em>are
            really what allow a business go from being a small fish in a big
            pond, to a giant heavy hitter.</p>
          <p>Facebook groups are used by over one billion people, but that isn’t
            the reason they’re so powerful and important.</p>
          <p>The reason? <strong>Engagement.</strong></p>
          <p>Facebook groups are more intimate, they are more personal, and they
            tend to attract only your die hard fans.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div class="questionTitle middleFont">
            <h1>What Would You Do With a Group of Highly Engaged Fans?</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Imagine having a group of highly engaged customers. </p>
          <p>People that love your brand and that want to learn everything there
            is to know about it. </p>
          <p>People that don’t get enough of your content from your blog or
            Facebook page, and who want to spend more time discussing your
            industry with like-minded fans.</p>
          <p>In other words, you are <strong>building a community</strong>. A
            community that can support and buoy your company, and help to
            elevate it past the other stuffy businesses in your niche. </p>
          <div class="questionTitle middleFont">
            <h1>A Tribe of Die-Hard Fans</h1>
          </div>
          <p>That’s what really makes the difference for businesses, because
            those fans become ‘brand ambassadors’. </p>
          <p>They won’t only read and react to everything you post, they won’t
            only buy your new products: they’ll also be your biggest advocates
            and marketers. Because they BELIEVE in the message you are selling.</p>
          <p>Facebook groups allow you to do this, by offering a secluded place
            for people who <strong>want more of your content</strong> to
            discuss matters relating to your business. You’ll be able to speak
            to those most loyal fans directly, and build the kind of
            relationship that translates to true brand loyalty. And they’re
            HIGHLY monetizable.</p>
          <p>But while this option is available to you, it’s something that <strong>most
              businesses have no idea how to accomplish</strong>. Most
            businesses that try their hand at Facebook groups will find that
            they spend a lot of time posting content to groups that provide no
            real value. </p>
          <p>They flounder without a clear message or clear reason for people to
            join their groups. Ultimately, the time they invest is worthless and
            they get NOTHING from the experience.</p>
          <p>Groups work differently from blogs and other forms of content
            marketing. They work differently from Facebook pages even! And
            that’s why they need a completely different approach.</p>
          <p>The good news is, I've written a guide on how you can get started
            starting today.</p>
